# A Practical Intro to Automerge

Automerge is a suite of tools for building [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first) web applications with real-time synchronization that works on and offline. 

In this tutorial, you'll build a local-first multiplayer todo-list app with TypeScript, React, [Vite](https://vite.dev), and Automerge. You'll discover how to:

- Represent data as Automerge [Documents](automerge.org/TODO)
- [Change](TODO) documents' data and [merge](TODO) changes from different peers
- Store & synchronize a set of documents in an Automerge [Repository](automerge.org/TODO) 
- Build a multiplayer realtime web app client with Automerge's [React library](automerge.org/TODO)

## Model Data as `Document`s

[Documents](automerge.org/TODO) are the central concept of Automerge. An Automerge document is a JSON-like data structure with superpowers, aka a Conflict-free Replicated Data Type, or [CRDT](http://crdt.tech).

Each document is identified by a unique [ID](automerge.org/TODO), e.g.: 

`automerge:45NuQi1e45PKsemx8GhSCu62gyag`

 Automerge documents support various [data types](./documents/), including builtin JS datatypes and `Date`, as well as Automerge-specific types including an incrementing integer known as a `Counter`.
 
 
 You'll use the `@automerge/automerge` package to define document(s) that [model the data](./cookbook/modeling-data/) your app needs. 

 ### Defining a Document's Shape

In App.tsx, import the `@automerge/automerge` package, then use builtin JS data types combined with a few Automerge-specific data types exposed by this package to define the shape of the document(s) your app will need. 

For example, for a simple app that counts how many times a button has been clicked, you might have a `CounterDoc` with a `counter` property storing a special numeric value `A.Counter`.


```ts
// App.tsx
import { next as A } from '@automerge/automerge';

interface CounterDoc {
  counter: A.Counter;
} 
```

### Changing Documents

Although they might look like JSON objects, Automerge Documents are much more powerful.
 
As changes are made to a Document's data, those changes are stored along with the data itself, and can be "undone", "replayed", and synchronized with other changes made to the same document.

Instead of manipulating a `Document`'s values directly, in Automerge you'll write a callback function with the transformation you want to apply to the given doc. Pass the document & the callback function to the `A.change` method, and Automerge will return a new copy of the document with the callback's changes applied. 


For example, to rename our counter doc we can set its `.name` property:

```ts
const renamedCounter = A.change(counter, d => d.name = 'button clicks');
```

And to increment the counter itself we can call `.counter.increment(1)`: 

```ts
const incrementedCounter = A.change(counter, d => d.counter.increment(1));
```


<Admonition>

Documents are [immutable](TODO), so each change creates a new document while the original document remains unaltered.


```ts
const renamedCounter = A.change(counter, d => d.name = 'button clicks');
renamedCounter.name // 'button clicks'
counter.name // 'clicks'
```

</Admonition>

### Merging Changes

As the name implies, one of the key powers of Automerge is its ability to [merge](TODO) different changes to a given document, much like git lets you merge multiple edits to a given file. 

Pass two documents with different changes to `A.merge`, and Automerge will return a new document that includes the changes from both:

```ts
const increased = A.change(A.clone(counter), d => d.counter.increment(10));
const renamed = A.change(A.clone(counter), d => d.name = 'button clicks');
const merged = A.merge(increased, renamed);
console.log(merged.name); // 'button clicks'
console.log(merged.counter.value) // 10
```

When merging two different changes to the same property, Automerge uses various strategies to avoid [conflicts](https://automerge.org/docs/documents/conflicts/) and ensure that the merged document will be identical for every user.

## Manage Docs with a `Repo`

As shown above, you can manipulate documents directly with `A`, which is useful for understanding Automerge and taking it for a spin. However, in a real app you will typically interact with Documents within an Automerge [Repository](https://automerge.org/docs/repositories/). 

A Repository, or [Repo](automerge.org/TODO), keeps track of all the documents you load and makes sure they're properly synchronized and stored. It provides an interface to create, modify, and manage documents locally, send & receive changes to/from others, and merge those changes as needed. 

Repos are the second core concept you need to build apps with Automerge. The `@automerge/automerge-repo` package lets you create & configure a Repo for documents created with `@automerge/automerge`.


### Initialize a repository

Each Repo needs to know:
- Where its documents should be saved, specified via a [`StorageAdapter`](automerge.org/TODO)
- How/Where to send, retrieve, and synchronize doc updates, specified via zero or more [`NetworkAdapter`](automerge.org/TODO)s

For this app, you can store documents in an IndexedDB in the browser, and send changes over a Broadcast Channel to keep tabs within the same browser (origin) in sync. 

In `src/main.tsx`, import and instantiate the IndexedDB `StorageAdapter` and BroadcastChannel `NetworkAdapter` from their `@automerge` packages:

```ts
import { IndexedDBStorageAdapter } from "@automerge/automerge-repo-storage-indexeddb"
import { BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter } from '@automerge/automerge-repo-network-broadcastchannel'

const broadcast = new BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter();
const indexedDB = new IndexedDBStorageAdapter();
```

Then, create a new `Repo` by passing in those adapters like so:

```js
const repo = new Repo({
  storage: indexedDB,
  network: [broadcast],
})
```

<Admonition>

If the Automerge project doesn't have a pre-built adapter that fits your needs, you can create [custom adapter(s)](./repositories/storage/#roll-your-own) as needed. 

</Admonition>

### Create or Find a Document

To create a new document in a repo, you can call `repo.create()` and pass in the initial values of the document:

```ts
const counterHandle = repo.create<CounterDoc>({
  name: 'clicks',
  counter: new A.Counter(),
})
```

This returns a [`DocHandle`](TODO) object, which provides an interface for working with the document. 

The `DocHandle` has a `.url` property with the document's unique ID: 

```ts
counterHandle.url // automerge:1234...
``` 

For this counter app, we want to either retrieve the existing counter document if it exists, or create a new document if we don't have one already. 

It's common practice to pass document IDs around as URL hashes. In this case, you can check the URL hash for a document ID, and if none exists, we'll create a new document and set its ID in the URL hash. (In a production app you'd probably handle routing differently, but this is enough for our example.)


```typescript
const rootDocUrl = `${document.location.hash.substring(1)}`
let handle
if (isValidAutomergeUrl(rootDocUrl)) {
    handle = repo.find(rootDocUrl)
} else {
    handle = repo.create<CounterDoc>({
      name: 'clicks',
      counter: new A.Counter();
    })
}
const docUrl = document.location.hash = handle.url
```

### Read the document


The handle's `doc` method asynchronously loads & returns the document's data from the `Repo`'s storage:

```ts
await counterHandle.doc()
```

(There is also a synchronous `.docSync()` method which returns undefined if the document is unavailable either because it is still loading, or because it can't be found.)

<Admonition type="info">

If you want to render loading states differently from an unavailable state, you can inspect `handle.state` and branch accordingly.

</Admonition>


### Manipulate the document


A `DocHandle` also exposes a `.change` method allows you to modify the document. It accepts a callback function for updating the document's data, as we saw before:  

```ts
counterHandle.change(d => { d.counter.increment(10) })
```

The `.change` method takes care of storing new changes, and notifies any peers of new changes by emitting `"change"` events whenever the document changes -- either through local actions or over the network, as determined by the configuration of your `Repo`.


## Automerge in React

To make it easier to work with Automerge Repos and Documents in client-side React apps, the `@automerge/automerge-repo-react-hooks` package provides some React-specific conveniences.

### `RepoContext` and `useRepo` hook

A `RepoContext` lets you make your Repo available throughout your React application, via the corresponding `useRepo` hook which can be called in any client component.

In `main.tsx`, modify the `React.render()` call to wrap the `App` component with a  `RepoContext.Provider`, passing in the given `repo` object:

```tsx
import { RepoContext } from '@automerge/automerge-repo-react-hooks'

//...

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RepoContext.Provider value={repo}>
      <App docUrl={docUrl} />
    </RepoContext.Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```


### `useDocument` Hook

Once you have the URL (ID) of the document you want to work with, you can access & modify it from your components with the `useDocument` hook:

```tsx
// App.tsx
import {next as A} from "@automerge/automerge"
import type {AutomergeUrl} from '@automerge/automerge-repo'
import {useDocument} from '@automerge/automerge-repo-react-hooks'

function App({ docUrl }: { docUrl: AutomergeUrl }) {
  const [doc, changeDoc] = useDocument<CounterDoc>(docUrl);

  // ...
}
```

The `doc` value returned by the hook will initially be `undefined` while the document is loading. Once loaded, `doc` will have the shape of the Document you specified, and will update reactively every time the document changes.

To display the current count, you can render `doc.counter.value` (just make sure to handle the `undefined` loading case):

```tsx
// App.tsx

function App({ docUrl }: { docUrl: AutomergeUrl }) {
  const [doc, changeDoc] = useDocument<CounterDoc>(docUrl);

  return (//...
  
    <button>
      count is {doc && doc.counter.value}
    </button>

    //...
  )
```  

As you might expect, the `changeDoc` function returned by the `useDoc` hook allows us to change the given document as needed, usually in response to user action. Powered by `A.change` under the hood, `changeDoc` accepts an update callback representing the change to be applied to the existing document.

To increment the counter every time a user clicks a button, we can use `changeDoc` in the button's `onClick` handler to increment the counter's value, like so:

```tsx
    <button onClick={() => changeDoc((d) => d.counter.increment(1))}>
      count is {doc && doc.counter.value}
    </button>
```

## Collaboration in Automerge

### Collaborating Locally

Since the Repo in this app uses a `BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter`, any changes made to documents in that Repo immediately appear in any other clients with the same origin (i.e. tabs within the same browser).

Go ahead and try this out. Open a second (or third) tab with the same URL and see how as you click the counter in any tab, the others update.

If you close all the tabs and reopen them, the counter value is preserved.

Congratulations! You have a working Automerge-backed React app with live local synchronization.

### Collaborating over the internet

In addition to syncing changes locally, changes to your Automerge Repo can be synced with any other user(s) of the same app. 

A document's URL is the unique identifier that allows the Repo to sync the document with any peer who knows that URL. 

Add a network adapter to the `Repo` which syncs to a sync server via a websocket. Add the following dependency to the web app we've been building:


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
$ npm i @automerge/automerge-repo-network-websocket
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
$ yarn add @automerge/automerge-repo-network-websocket
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then add a network adapter connecting the repo to `sync.automerge.org`

```tsx
// main.tsx

// Add this import:
import { BrowserWebSocketClientAdapter } from "@automerge/automerge-repo-network-websocket";

const repo = new Repo({
    network: [
        new BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter(),
        // Add this line:
        new BrowserWebSocketClientAdapter('wss://sync.automerge.org')
    ],
    storage: new IndexedDBStorageAdapter(),
})
```

Now, when the Repo sees any changes it will sync them not only locally via the BroadcastChannel, but also over a websocket connection to `sync.automerge.org`, and any other process can connect to that server and use the URL to get the changes we've made. 

:::note

The Automerge project provides a public sync server for you to experiment with, at `sync.automerge.org`. This is not a private instance, and as an experimental service has no reliability or data safety guarantees. Basically, it's good for demos and prototyping, but run your own sync server for production uses.

:::

To see this in action, open the same URL (including the document ID) in a different browser, or on a different device. Unlike the local-only version, you'll now see the counter updates synced across _all_ open clients.

###  Network Not Required

Now that the Repo is syncing changes remotely, what happens when the websocket connection is unavailable?

Since the repo stores documents locally with the `IndexedDBStorageAdapter`,  methods like `Repo.find` will consult local storage to retrieve/modify documents, so clients can create new documents while disconnected, and any clients who've already loaded a given document will still be able to make changes to it while offline.

Once connectivity has been re-established, the Repo will sync any local changes with those from remote peers, so everyone ultimately sees the same data. 

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've built a local-first, offline-capable app that supports multiplayer collaboration locally and over the network.
