# Meet Automerge: A Quick Tour

Automerge is a suite of tools for building [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first) web applications with real-time synchronization that works on and offline. 

In this tutorial, you'll build a local-first multiplayer todo-list app with TypeScript, React, [Vite](https://vite.dev), and Automerge. You'll discover how to:

- Represent data as Automerge [Documents](automerge.org/TODO)
- [Change](TODO) documents' data and [merge](TODO) changes from different peers
- Store & synchronize a set of documents in an Automerge [Repository](automerge.org/TODO) 
- Build a multiplayer realtime web app client with Automerge's [React library](automerge.org/TODO)

## Model Data as `Document`s

[Documents](automerge.org/TODO) are the central concept of Automerge. An Automerge document is a JSON-like data structure with superpowers, aka a Conflict-free Replicated Data Type, or [CRDT](http://crdt.tech).

Each document is identified by a unique [ID](automerge.org/TODO), e.g.: 

`automerge:45NuQi1e45PKsemx8GhSCu62gyag`

 Automerge documents support various [data types](./documents/), including builtin JS datatypes and `Date`, as well as Automerge-specific types including an incrementing integer known as a `Counter`.
 
 
 You'll use the `@automerge/automerge` package to define document(s) that [model the data](./cookbook/modeling-data/) your app needs. 

 ### Create a todo document

In App.tsx, import the `@automerge/automerge` package, then use builtin JS data types combined with a few Automerge-specific data types exposed by this package to define the shape of the document(s) your app will need. 

For example, for a simple app that counts how many times a button has been clicked, you might have a `CounterDoc` with two properties: a `name` string and a `counter` which we can represent with a special numeric value `A.Counter`.

You can manually create a new Automerge document from a JS object with `A.from()`:

```ts
import { next as A } from '@automerge/automerge';


interface CounterDoc {
  name: string;
  counter: A.Counter;
} 

const counter: CounterDoc = A.from({
  name: 'clicks',
  counter: new A.Counter(),
});
```

### Changing Documents

Although they might look like JSON objects, Automerge Documents are much more powerful.
 
As changes are made to a Document's data, those changes are stored along with the data itself, and can be "undone", "replayed", and synchronized with other changes made to the same document.

Instead of manipulating a `Document`'s values directly, in Automerge you'll write a callback function with the transformation you want to apply to the given doc. Pass the document & the callback function to the `A.change` method, and Automerge will return a new copy of the document with the callback's changes applied. 


For example, to rename our counter doc we can set its `.name` property:

```ts
const renamedCounter = A.change(counter, d => d.name = 'button clicks');
```

And to increment the counter itself we can call `.counter.increment(1)`: 

```ts
const incrementedCounter = A.change(counter, d => d.counter.increment(1));
```


<Admonition>

Documents are [immutable](TODO), so each change creates a new document while the original document remains unaltered.


```ts
const renamedCounter = A.change(counter, d => d.name = 'button clicks');
renamedCounter.name // 'button clicks'
counter.name // 'clicks'
```

</Admonition>

### Merging Changes

As the name implies, one of the key powers of Automerge is its ability to [merge](TODO) different changes to a given document, much like git lets you merge multiple edits to a given file. 

Pass two documents with different changes to `A.merge`, and Automerge will return a new document that includes the changes from both:

```ts
const increased = A.change(A.clone(counter), d => d.counter.increment(10));
const renamed = A.change(A.clone(counter), d => d.name = 'button clicks');
const merged = A.merge(increased, renamed);
console.log(merged.name); // 'button clicks'
console.log(merged.counter.value) // 10
```

When merging two different changes to the same property, Automerge uses various strategies to avoid [conflicts](https://automerge.org/docs/documents/conflicts/) and ensure that the merged document will be identical for every user.

## Manage Docs with a `Repo`

As shown above, you can manipulate documents directly with `A`, which is useful for understanding Automerge and taking it for a spin. However, in a real app you will typically interact with Documents within an Automerge [Repository](https://automerge.org/docs/repositories/). 

A Repository, or [Repo](automerge.org/TODO), keeps track of all the documents you load and makes sure they're properly synchronized and stored. It provides an interface to create, modify, and manage documents locally, send & receive changes to/from others, and merge those changes as needed. 

Repos are the second core concept you need to build apps with Automerge. The `@automerge/automerge-repo` package lets you create & configure a Repo for documents created with `@automerge/automerge`.


### Initialize a repository

Each Repo needs to know:
- Where its documents should be saved, specified via a [`StorageAdapter`](automerge.org/TODO)
- How/Where to send, retrieve, and synchronize doc updates, specified via zero or more [`NetworkAdapter`](automerge.org/TODO)s

For this app, you can store documents in an IndexedDB in the browser, and send changes over a Broadcast Channel to keep tabs within the same browser (origin) in sync. 

In `src/main.tsx`, import and instantiate the IndexedDB `StorageAdapter` and BroadcastChannel `NetworkAdapter` from their `@automerge` packages:

```ts
import { IndexedDBStorageAdapter } from "@automerge/automerge-repo-storage-indexeddb"
import { BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter } from '@automerge/automerge-repo-network-broadcastchannel'

const broadcast = new BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter();
const indexedDB = new IndexedDBStorageAdapter();
```

Then, create a new `Repo` by passing in those adapters like so:

```js
const repo = new Repo({
  storage: indexedDB,
  network: [broadcast],
})
```

<Admonition>

If the Automerge project doesn't have a pre-built adapter that fits your needs, you can create [custom adapter(s)](./repositories/storage/#roll-your-own) as needed. 

</Admonition>

### Create or Find a Document

To create a new document in a repo, you can call `repo.create()` and pass in the initial values of the document:

```ts
const counterHandle = repo.create<CounterDoc>({
  name: 'clicks',
  counter: new A.Counter(),
})
```

This returns a [`DocHandle`](TODO) object, which provides an interface for working with the document. 

The `DocHandle` has a `.url` property with the document's unique ID: 

```ts
counterHandle.url // automerge:1234...
``` 

For this counter app, we want to either retrieve the existing counter document if it exists, or create a new document if we don't have one already. 

It's common practice to pass document IDs around as URL hashes. In this case, you can check the URL hash for a document ID, and if none exists, we'll create a new document and set its ID in the URL hash. (In a production app you'd probably handle routing differently, but this is enough for our example.)


```typescript
const rootDocUrl = `${document.location.hash.substring(1)}`
let handle
if (isValidAutomergeUrl(rootDocUrl)) {
    handle = repo.find(rootDocUrl)
} else {
    handle = repo.create<CounterDoc>({
      name: 'clicks',
      counter: new A.Counter();
    })
}
const docUrl = document.location.hash = handle.url
```

### Read the document


The handle's `doc` method asynchronously loads & returns the document's data from the `Repo`'s storage:

```ts
await counterHandle.doc()
```

(There is also a synchronous `.docSync()` method which returns undefined if the document is unavailable either because it is still loading, or because it can't be found.)

<Admonition type="info">

If you want to render loading states differently from an unavailable state, you can inspect `handle.state` and branch accordingly.

</Admonition>


### Manipulate the document


A `DocHandle` also exposes a `.change` method allows you to modify the document. It accepts a callback function for updating the document's data, as we saw before:  

```ts
counterHandle.change(d => { d.counter.increment(10) })
```

The `.change` method takes care of storing new changes, and notifies any peers of new changes by emitting `"change"` events whenever the document changes -- either through local actions or over the network, as determined by the configuration of your `Repo`.


## Automerge in React

To make it easier to work with Automerge Repos and Documents in client-side React apps, the `@automerge/automerge-repo-react-hooks` package provides some React-specific conveniences.

### `RepoContext` and `useRepo` hook

We also need to make the `repo` object we created available throughout the application, so we use a React Context provider for that. In `main.tsx`, modify the `React.render()` call to look like this:

```typescript
import { RepoContext } from '@automerge/automerge-repo-react-hooks'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RepoContext.Provider value={repo}>
      <App />
    </RepoContext.Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

Then, in `App.tsx` you can use the `useRepo` React hook to retrieve the repo saved in the surrounding context: 

### `useDocument` Hook

Once you have the URL (ID) of the document you want to work with, you can access & modify it from your components with the `useDocument` hook:

```typescript
// App.tsx
import {next as A} from "@automerge/automerge"
import type {AutomergeUrl} from '@automerge/automerge-repo'
import {useRepo, useDocument} from '@automerge/automerge-repo-react-hooks'

function App() {

  const repo = useRepo();

  const [doc, changeDoc] = useDocument<CounterDoc>(docUrl);

}
```

Now you've got access to the document in a more native React-style way: a hook that will update every time the document changes.

Our last step here is to change our code to use these new values by replacing how we render the `button` element.

```typescript
        <button onClick={() => changeDoc((d) => d.counter.increment(1))}>
          count is { doc && doc.counter.value }
        </button>
```

Go ahead and try this out. Open a second (or third) tab with the same URL and see how as you click the counter in any tab, the others update.

If you close all the tabs and reopen them, the counter value is preserved.

Congratulations! You have a working Automerge-backed React app with live local synchronization. How does it work? We'll learn through some experimentation in the next section.

## Collaborating over the internet

The handle we have created has a URL, we can access that with `DocHandle.url`, this URL can be used to sync the document with any peer who has it. Open up your browser debugger and run `console.log(handle.url)`, this should print something that looks like `"automerge:45NuQi1e45PKsemx8GhSCu62gyag"`, make a note of this for later.

First, we'll add a network adapter to the `Repo` in our web app which syncs to a sync server via a websocket. Add the following dependency to the web app we've been building:

```bash
yarn add @automerge/automerge-repo-network-websocket
```

Then add a network adapter connecting the repo to `sync.automerge.org`

```
// main.tsx
// Add this import
import { BrowserWebSocketClientAdapter } from "@automerge/automerge-repo-network-websocket"

...

// now update the repo definition to look like this:
const repo = new Repo({
    network: [
        new BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter(),
        // This is the new line
        new BrowserWebSocketClientAdapter('wss://sync.automerge.org')
    ],
    storage: new IndexedDBStorageAdapter(),
})
```

This creates a repo which syncs changes it sees to `sync.automerge.org`, and any other process can connect to that server and use the URL to get the changes we've made. 

:::note

The Automerge project provides a public sync server for you to experiment with `sync.automerge.org`. This is not a private instance, and as an experimental service has no reliability or data safety guarantees. Basically, it's good for demos and prototyping, but run your own sync server for production uses.

:::

To see this in action we'll create a little node app. Change into a clean directory and run

```bash
npm create @automerge/repo-node-app amg-quickstart
cd amg-quickstart
```

Now open `index.js` and add the following:


```js
// repo is already set up by the `repo-node-app` helper
const doc = repo.find("<url copied from the debugger>")
console.log(await doc.doc())
// This is required because we don't have a way of shutting down the repo
setTimeout(() => process.exit(), 1000)
```

Now run this with `node index.js` and you should see the contents of the document.

Now add the following at the end of `index.js` (but before the setTimeout)

```js
doc.change(d => {
    d.counter.increment(1)
})
```

This change will be reflected in any connected and listening handles. Go back to the original browser window and watch it as you run `node index.js`. What you should see is that every time you run the script the counter in the browser changes.

## Saving the document

If you provide a `Repo` with a `StorageAdapter` then it will save documents for use later. In the browser we might used IndexedDB:

```js
import { IndexedDBStorageAdapter } from "@automerge/automerge-repo-storage-indexeddb"
import { BrowserWebSocketClientAdapter } from "@automerge/automerge-repo-network-websocket"

const repo = new AutomergeRepo.Repo({
  network: [new BrowserWebSocketClientAdapter("wss://sync.automerge.org")],
  storage: new IndexedDBStorageAdapter(),
})
```

Documents will be stored in `IndexedDB` and methods like `Repo.find` will consult storage when loading. The upshot is that if you had a document locally, it will continue to be available regardless of whether you are connected to any peers.
