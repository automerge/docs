# Meet Automerge: A Builder's Tour

Automerge is a suite of tools for building [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first) web applications with real-time synchronization that works on and offline. 

In this tutorial, you'll build a local-first multiplayer app with TypeScript, React, [Vite](https://vite.dev), and Automerge. You'll discover how to:

- Represent data as Automerge [Documents](/docs/concepts/#documents)
- [Change](/docs/documents/conflicts/) documents' data and [merge](/docs/under-the-hood/merge_rules/) changes from different peers
- Store & synchronize a set of documents in an Automerge [Repository](/docs/concepts/#repositories) 
- Build a multiplayer realtime web app with the Automerge [React client](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo/tree/main/packages/automerge-repo-react-hooks)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Visit [localhost:5173/automerge-repo-quickstart/](http://localhost:5173/automerge-repo-quickstart/) to see the app in its "starter" state, as a basic React app not yet using Automerge: the task list can be edited, but changes are not synced between users, and all local changes are lost when the page is closed or reloaded. 

Let's fix all that with Automerge!

## Architecture of an Automerge App

Automerge apps rely on two key concepts: 
- An Automerge [Document](/docs/concepts/#documents) (Doc) models app data using a specialized data structure that supports conflict-free collaboration
- An Automerge [Repository](/docs/concepts/#repositories) (Repo) determines how/where the app stores and synchronizes those documents, locally and/or over the network.

In the exercises that follow, you'll modify the source code to:

1. Configure a Repository to store & sync document changes locally
1. Create/retrieve a task list Document by its Document URL
1. Use the Automerge React client to update the Doc's data on user input
1. Update the Repo to also sync changes over the network (when available)

## Manage docs with a `Repo`

A [`Repo`](/docs/repositories/) keeps track of all the documents you load and makes sure they're properly synchronized and stored. It provides an interface to: 
- create, modify, and manage documents locally
- send & receive changes to/from others, and 
- merge multiple changes as needed.

Each Repo needs to know:
  - Where its documents should be saved, specified via a [`StorageAdapter`](/docs/repositories/storage/)
  - How/Where to send, retrieve, and synchronize doc updates, specified via zero or more [`NetworkAdapter`](/docs/repositories/networking/)s


### Repo-related `@automerge` packages

The [`@automerge/automerge-repo` package](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo) lets you create & configure a Repo, specifying the `StorageAdapter` and `NetworkAdapter`(s) you need.

Those adapters can be imported from their respective `@automerge/automerge-repo-storage-*` and `@automerge/automerge-repo-network-*` packages.



<Admonition type='info' title="Roll your own adapter">

If none of the pre-built adapters fit your needs, you can create [custom adapter(s)](/docs/repositories/storage/#roll-your-own) as needed.

</Admonition>


### Create a local-first Repo

Currently, the task list app doesn't persist or sync any changes, even locally.

To add local multiplayer capabilities to the app, you'll initialize a local-first Repo to:
- save Docs client-side in the browser's [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API), using the `IndexedDBStorageAdapter` from `@automerge/automerge-repo-storage-indexeddb`
- keep local users (i.e. tabs within the same browser/origin) in sync via a [Broadcast Channel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API), using the `BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter`. 

<Exercise>

#### Import your storage & network adapters

In `src/main.tsx`, import and instantiate an `IndexedDBStorageAdapter` and `BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter` from their `@automerge/automerge-repo-*` packages, which have already been included in the project dependencies.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```tsx title="src/main.tsx"
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.tsx'
import './index.css'
// highlight-start
import { IndexedDBStorageAdapter } from "@automerge/automerge-repo-storage-indexeddb"
import { BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter } from '@automerge/automerge-repo-network-broadcastchannel'

const broadcast = new BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter();
const indexedDB = new IndexedDBStorageAdapter();
// highlight-end

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)

```

</details>


#### Initialize your Repo

Using the `Repo` constructor from `@automerge/automerge-repo`, initialize your new repo by passing in the given adapters as the `storage` and `network` properties of the options object accepted by the constructor.

<details>

```tsx title="src/main.tsx"
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.tsx'
import './index.css'
import { IndexedDBStorageAdapter } from "@automerge/automerge-repo-storage-indexeddb"
import { BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter } from '@automerge/automerge-repo-network-broadcastchannel'
// highlight-next-line
import { Repo } from '@automerge/automerge-repo'

const broadcast = new BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter();
const indexedDB = new IndexedDBStorageAdapter();

// highlight-start
const repo = new Repo({
  storage: indexedDB,
  network: [broadcast],
})
// highlight-end

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)

```

</details>

</Exercise>

### Automerge in React: the `RepoContext`

The [`@automerge/automerge-repo-react-hooks` package](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo-react-hooks) provides some React-specific conveniences for working with Automerge repositories.

A `RepoContext` makes your repo and its documents available throughout your React application, via `useRepo` and `useDocument` hooks which can be called in any client component.

<Exercise>

#### Add a `RepoContext` to the React app

In `main.tsx`, import `RepoContext` and modify the `React.render()` call to wrap the `App` component with a  `RepoContext.Provider`, passing in your fresh new `repo` to the context's `value` prop.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```tsx title="src/main.tsx"
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.tsx'
import './index.css'
import { IndexedDBStorageAdapter } from "@automerge/automerge-repo-storage-indexeddb"
import { BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter } from '@automerge/automerge-repo-network-broadcastchannel'
import { Repo } from '@automerge/automerge-repo'
// highlight-next-line
import { RepoContext } from '@automerge/automerge-repo-react-hooks'

const broadcast = new BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter();
const indexedDB = new IndexedDBStorageAdapter();

const repo = new Repo({
  storage: indexedDB,
  network: [broadcast],
})

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
  {/* highlight-next-line */}
    <RepoContext.Provider value={repo}>
      <App />
        {/* highlight-next-line */}
    </RepoContext.Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>
)

```
</details>

</Exercise>


## Working with `Document`s

### Doc Handles & URLs

To create a new document, pass its initial value to `repo.create()`, which accepts a type parameter with the expected document schema:

```ts
const listHandle = repo.create<TaskList>({
  tasks: [
    {
      title: 'Learn Automerge',
      done: false
    }
  ],
});
```

The object returned from `repo.create()` is a [`DocHandle`](/docs/repositories/dochandles/), which provides an interface for working with the document.

A `DocHandle`'s `.url` property provides the document's unique identifier:

```ts
listHandle.url // automerge:37Qr33Ub26dnS2txNCjEJDC37KFT
``` 

To retrieve a handle for a document that's already in your repo, you can pass its document URL to `repo.find()`:

```ts
const existingDocHandle = repo.find(existingDoc.url)
```

It's common practice to pass document URLs around as URL hashes. For example: 

`http://my-automerge-app.com/automerge-repo-quickstart/#automerge:37Qr33Ub26dnS2txNCjEJDC37KFT`

The `automerge-repo` package exports an `isValidAutomergeUrl()` function that you can use to determine if a given hash is a valid Document URL. 

In your task list app, you'll check the page's hash and: 
- retrieve the existing task list document if it exists, or 
- create a new document if we don't have one already. 


<Exercise>

### Create or Find a Document

- Check the page's URL hash (`document.location.hash`), if any, to see if it contains a valid Automerge document URL. (You'll need to strip off the leading `#` first.)
- If so, pass the doc URL to `repo.find()` to retrieve the document's handle.
- Otherwise, create a new document with `repo.create` and set its document URL in the page's URL hash. 

(Note: In a production app you'd probably handle routing differently, but this is enough for our example.)

<Solution>

```tsx title="src/main.tsx"
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App, { type TaskList } from './App.tsx'
import './index.css'
// highlight-next-line
import { Repo, isValidAutomergeUrl } from '@automerge/automerge-repo'
import { BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter } from '@automerge/automerge-repo-network-broadcastchannel'
import { BrowserWebSocketClientAdapter } from '@automerge/automerge-repo-network-websocket'
import { IndexedDBStorageAdapter } from "@automerge/automerge-repo-storage-indexeddb"
import { RepoContext } from '@automerge/automerge-repo-react-hooks'

const repo = new Repo({
  network: [new BrowserWebSocketClientAdapter("wss://sync.automerge.org"), new BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter()],
  storage: new IndexedDBStorageAdapter(),
})

// highlight-start
const rootDocUrl = document.location.hash.substring(1)

let handle
if (isValidAutomergeUrl(rootDocUrl)) {
  handle = repo.find(rootDocUrl)
} else {
  handle = repo.create<TaskList>({
    tasks: [
      {
        title: 'Learn Automerge',
        done: false
      }
    ],
  });
}

document.location.hash = handle.url
// highlight-end

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RepoContext.Provider value={repo}>
      <App />
    </RepoContext.Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

</Solution>
</Exercise>

### Automerge in React: `useDocument`

Once you have the URL of the document you want to work with, you can access & modify it from your components with the `useDocument` hook from `automerge-repo-react-hooks`.

Similar to React's `useState`, `useDocument` returns a two-item array with a reactive `doc` value representing the document's current contents and a `changeDoc` function which can be used to update that value.

<Exercise>

#### Access the given document in the `App` component

Update the `App` component in `src/App.tsx` to accept a `docUrl` prop. In `src/main.tsx`, pass in the URL of the created/retrieved document to the `App` component.

<Solution>

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
// ...
import { useState } from 'react'
// highlight-next-line
import type { AutomergeUrl } from '@automerge/automerge-repo';

// ...

// highlight-next-line
function App({ docUrl }: { docUrl: AutomergeUrl }) {
  // ...
}

export default App
```

```tsx title="src/main.tsx"
// ...

document.location.hash = handle.url

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RepoContext.Provider value={repo}>
    {/* highlight-next-line */}
      <App docUrl={handle.url} />
    </RepoContext.Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

</Solution>

</Exercise>

<Exercise>

#### Load the task list document

In `App.tsx`, replace the call to the `useState` hook with a call to `useDocument` that retrieves the document & change function for the given `docUrl`.


<Solution>


```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
// ...
// highlight-next-line
import { useDocument } from '@automerge/automerge-repo-react-hooks'
import type { AutomergeUrl } from '@automerge/automerge-repo'

// ...

function App({ docUrl }: { docUrl: AutomergeUrl }) {
  
  // highlight-next-line
  const [doc, changeDoc] = useDocument<TaskList>(docUrl)

  // ...
}

export default App
```

</Solution> 

</Exercise>



### Read a document's contents

The `doc` value returned by the hook will initially be `undefined` while the document is loading. Once loaded, `doc` will have the shape of the Document you specified, and will update reactively every time the document changes.

In App.tsx replace the page header text. Use the `doc` value to make the title display the total number of tasks currently in the list (remember to handle the `undefined` loading case).


```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
// ...

function App({ docUrl }: { docUrl: AutomergeUrl }) {
  const [doc, changeDoc] = useDocument<TaskList>(docUrl);

  return (
    <>
      <header>
        <a href="https://automerge.org" target="_blank">
          <img src={automergeLogo} className="logo" alt="Automerge logo" />
        </a>
        <h1>
        {/* highlight-next-line */}
          {doc ? doc.tasks.length : 'Loading'} Tasks
        </h1>
      </header>
      
      {/* ... */}
    </>
  )
}
```


### Edit a document

The `changeDoc` function returned by the `useDoc` hook allows us to update the given document as needed, usually in response to user action. 

`changeDoc` accepts a callback representing the change to be applied to the existing document, which is passed as the callback's first argument. For example: 

```js
// Mark the first task as completed:
changeDoc(d => d.tasks[0].done = true)

// Delete all tasks, resetting the list to empty:
changeDoc(d => d.tasks = [])
```

The `useDocument` hook is aware of the `repo` in use (thanks, `RepoContext!`), so whenever a document is changed, its new value will be saved in the given StorageAdapter(s) and synced to other users via the given NetworkAdapter(s).


### Documents vs. JS Objects

Although they look as simple as Plain Old JavaScript Objects (POJOs), Automerge Documents are secretly much more powerful.
 
As changes are made to a Document's data, those changes are stored along with the data itself, and can be "undone", "replayed", and synchronized with other changes made to the same document.

This type of reassignment in the change handler works well for [simple values](/docs/documents/values/) like a `boolean`, but when working with text - e.g. to change the `.title` of the task - you'll use `A.updateText()` to [more efficiently change string values](/docs/documents/text/) than would be the case with a simple string reassignment.


<Admonition type="info">

Automerge Documents are [immutable](/docs/hello/#design-principles), so each change creates a new document while the original document remains unaltered.

</Admonition>

```ts
import {updateText} from '@automerge/automerge/next'

const renamed = A.updateText(list.tasks[0], ['title'], 'Learn more Automerge');
console.log(renamed.tasks[0].title) // 'Learn more Automerge'
console.log(renamed.tasks[0].title) // 'Learn Automerge'
```


### Merging Changes

As the name implies, one of the key powers of Automerge is its ability to [merge](/docs/under-the-hood/merge_rules/) different changes to a given document, much like git lets you merge multiple edits to a given file.

Pass two documents with different changes to `A.merge`, and Automerge will return a new document that includes the changes from both:

```ts
const renamedMore = A.updateText(list.tasks[0], ['title'], 'Learn more Automerge');
const renamedWrite = A.updateText(list.tasks[0], ['title'], 'Write Automerge')

// TODO @vakila syntax
const merged = A.merge([renamedMore, renamedWrite]); 
// TODO @vakila fact check
console.log(merged.tasks[0].title); // 'Write more Automerge'  
```

When merging two different changes to the same property, Automerge uses various strategies to avoid [conflicts](https://automerge.org/docs/documents/conflicts/) and ensure that the merged document will be identical for every user.



## Collaboration in Automerge

### Collaborating Locally

Since the Repo in this app uses a `BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter`, any changes made to documents in that Repo immediately appear in any other clients with the same origin (i.e. tabs within the same browser).

Go ahead and try this out. Open a second (or third) tab with the same URL and edit the list, observing how other clients' lists are updated accordingly.

If you close all the tabs and reopen them, the document is preserved, as it is stored in your browser's IndexedDB.

Congratulations! You have a working Automerge-backed React app with live local synchronization.

### Collaborating over the internet

In addition to syncing changes locally, changes to your Automerge Repo can be synced with any other user(s) of the same app. 

A document's URL is the unique identifier that allows the Repo to sync the document with any peer who knows that URL. 

Add a network adapter to the `Repo` which syncs to a sync server via a websocket. Add the following dependency to the web app we've been building:


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
$ npm i @automerge/automerge-repo-network-websocket
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
$ yarn add @automerge/automerge-repo-network-websocket
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then add a network adapter connecting the repo to `sync.automerge.org`

```tsx
// main.tsx

// Add this import:
import { BrowserWebSocketClientAdapter } from "@automerge/automerge-repo-network-websocket";

const repo = new Repo({
    network: [
        new BroadcastChannelNetworkAdapter(),
        // Add this line:
        new BrowserWebSocketClientAdapter('wss://sync.automerge.org')
    ],
    storage: new IndexedDBStorageAdapter(),
})
```

Now, when the Repo sees any changes it will sync them not only locally via the BroadcastChannel, but also over a websocket connection to `sync.automerge.org`, and any other process can connect to that server and use the URL to get the changes we've made. 

<Admonition type="note">

The Automerge project provides a public sync server for you to experiment with, at `sync.automerge.org`. This is not a private instance, and as an experimental service has no reliability or data safety guarantees. Basically, it's good for demos and prototyping, but run your own sync server for production uses.

</Admonition>

To see this in action, open the same URL (including the document ID) in a different browser, or on a different device. Unlike the local-only version, you'll now see the data updates synced across _all_ open clients.

###  Network Not Required

Now that the Repo is syncing changes remotely, what happens when the websocket connection is unavailable?

Since the repo stores documents locally with the `IndexedDBStorageAdapter`,  methods like `Repo.find` will consult local storage to retrieve/modify documents, so clients can create new documents while disconnected, and any clients who've already loaded a given document will still be able to make changes to it while offline.

Once connectivity has been re-established, the Repo will sync any local changes with those from remote peers, so everyone ultimately sees the same data. 

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've built a local-first, offline-capable app that supports multiplayer collaboration locally and over the network.
